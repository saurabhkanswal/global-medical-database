#Global Medical Database Website

#Project Title
Global Medical Database Website

<-- The main objective of the website is to built a shareble environment for patient, doctor, pathology lab and dispensary shop. In our Idea, a healthcare database serves to replace the paper documents, file folders, and filing cabinets of old. The data is now more convenient and immediate.

Features and Advantages: 
* many times patient lost his medical reports so by digitalization of medical reports he can acces it anytime and can save his extra expenditure. 
* in case the patient came across an acident so in that case it becomes very time consuming to examine the patient or to get patient medical history in time as the doctor has to done all test again. however to overcome this problem we are providing shareable environment for doctor where he can access patient medical report and data by unique ID. * shareable environment which can encourage DIGITAL INDIA MISSION.
* can save precious time of patient and doctor.
